Project for teaching beginner software developer on the basics of modular software design on C++

There are three branches in this repo:
- master : project with empty (skeleton only) files, to be filled on practice session
- completed project : project with completed files, where each module is separated into its own file
- interface project : project with completed files, where an interface for money counter is used to demonstrate modular software design using interface-style via c++ abstract class

You can compile it via makefile and gcc (or your own compiler choice) OR you can open the project using CodeBlocks
